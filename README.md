# watchOS iMessage Video Demo

In this project, you'll find a watchOS app that allows you to send an H264 or H265 video using SwiftUI's ShareLink.

Sending a video always fails on watchOS 9.1. The Messages app shows an infinite loader and the loading never completes.

## Instructions
- Open the demo project
- Setup code-signing
- Run the project on an Apple Watch
- Tap one of the two buttons to show the ShareLink sheet and send a video
- Observe the behavior of iMessage app. In my experience, the video can never be sent.
